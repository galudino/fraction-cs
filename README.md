# fraction-cs
Abstraction for a Fraction (ratio of integers), in C.

## What's this?
I'm trying to get a feel for C#, as someone who has spent
some time writing in C++.

This is pretty much an old project from my first year of CS,
which was originally written in Java -- now redone in C#.

Currently using `mono` to build.

## If you are running a Unix-based operating system...

Use the `makebuild` script to build the sources for `main.app`,<br>then you can invoke the `run` script, which does the following
in the terminal:

```
mono main.app dat/input.dat
```

## If you are running Microsoft Windows/using Visual Studio...
